## 1. Background Introduction

### 1.1 Bitcoin

The concept of Bitcoin was first proposed by Nakamoto on November 2008, and was formally born on January 2009. According to the idea of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a virtual encrypted digital currency in the form of a decentralized payment system called Peer to Peer (p2p) network.

Unlike all currencies, instead of being issued by a specific monetary institution, Bitcoin is generated by a large number of calculations based on a specific algorithm. Bitcoin economy uses a distributed database composed of many nodes in the whole P2P network to confirm and record all transactions, and uses cryptographic design to ensure the security of all links of currency circulation. The de-centralization of P2P and the algorithm itself can ensure that the value of the currency cannot be manipulated artificially by making a large number of bitcoins. Cryptographic design allows bitcoins to be transferred or paid only by real owners in an anonymous way of currency ownership and circulation transactions. The biggest difference between Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is that the total amount of Bitcoin is relatively scarce, whose total number will be permanently limited to 21 million.

### 1.2 The Difference between Bitcoin and Stocks as investment instruments

Bitcoin, who has recently aroused public attention as an investment instrument, is intrinsically different from stocks in financial features. Stocks represent the ownership of a company's assets, which can bring returns to investors. Therefore, as long as the company's performance grows, the value of stocks in investors' share will increase. Even if the stock price falls and the market value evaporates, the corresponding physical assets still exist. However, Bitcoin itself does not create wealth, nor does it correspond to any physical assets, etc. Also, the monetary function of Bitcoin is also virtual, which is different from precious metals such as gold and government credit currency.
Capital speculation is an important driving factor in terms of the fluctuation of digital currency price. Bitcoin prices fluctuate dramatically, which is mainly caused by international and domestic speculation behaviors. Meanwhile, since Bitcoin has no underlying fundamental value, it is impossible to predict the price of Bitcoin in the same way as predicting the stock price based on macro market and company fundamentals. Therefore, ordinary investors face enormous risks when investing in Bitcoins due to the difficulty in predicting its price moving trends.
